//primitive date types are boolean, number, string, null, undefined and symbol
//non primitive are arrays and functions but they both are called objects.

let a=10;
console.log(typeof (a));

let b=new Number(10);
console.log(typeof b);
console.log(b);
console.log(b.valueOf());

// we can convert any primitive to non primitive using new keyword just like we do in java

let name;
console.log(name);

let c=null;
console.log(c);
